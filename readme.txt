== Description ==

The TweetMeme Twitter Follow Button is a new way to gain extra Twitter Followers, it allows your blog visitors to instantly know if they are already following your Twitter account or not, if not then it allows the visitor to follow you without leaving your site.

The button has been designed for simplicity and comes in three styles compact, standard and square. 

The Follow Button has a live counter so that you can see visually if the user is worth following just based upon the count and matches the style and ability of the TweetMeme ReTweet button.  The button also knows who you are already following and shows the + sign to remind you to add the new users that you discover through the Follow Button.  We also add in a Wordpress sidebar widget and the ability to add the follow button to posts on a per-author basis.
